# GamingRoom
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client Gaming Room wanted us to create a desktop version of their game Draw It Or Lose It. They requested software that would be able to support multiple players and have the database to hold a certain amount of images for the game. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The thing I feel i exceeded in writing was the descriptions for the why I recommended for which operating system that the Gaming Room should use for the their application. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
By walking through it step by step allowed me to see what things needed to be fixed and how they had an effect on the program as a whole. By taking it step by step I was able to see all the changes along the way.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I feel that I did not go into enough details in the development requirements to fully explain the effect each operating system would have on each section.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I focused on what they wanted out of the system and tried to tailor a set up to get them all the requirements that they wanted while still allowing ease of access for the development and the players.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I think the best thing when developing software is to use a language that works best for not only the operating system on the server side but also the client side as while. If you just stick to one side it could cause issues or not allow some players to even access the game.
